# kikibelet
A music player inspired by Musicolet and Musikcube

# Why this project matters?
This is intend to be a player with highly customizable interface and multiuse purposes in Linux environments or simillar, made with Rust.
At this moment I'm writing, there's no project that have a TUI and GUI interface at the same time. Nevertheless projects are tending to focus in one type of use over other. My goal here is try shift that perspective, creating a standalone music player.

Besides what I think, I want to indulge myself in some project that I can learn, starting real programming, having real effects and something I could call a personal progress of mine as time passes by.

I must say that for now, this project is solely for my personal use and fun. And I hope archieve something more in the future.

# Why Rust?
Rust is good for communities as it can let people maintain and organize their own development space and libraries, while enabling no problems with dependencies or managing memory properly. For a music player performance, clean code and open-source perspective there's an intrinsic value using it. Althought it could scale up and won likely the same by following the steps of other programming languages, I choose this one for its natural practical implementation, also because I have a desire to learn it, too.

Anyway, I would change the project's language and start from scratch if no good harvest will grow stucking it within Rust in the long run.
